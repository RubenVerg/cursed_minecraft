# Cursed Minecraft

A collection of assets to make your favorite cursed Minecraft images!

## Contents

The repo is divided in two parts, `assets` and `img`. Assets contains either Minecraft images (`assets/minecraft`) or edited 'cursed' images (`assets/cursed`). Img contains finished images that I've released in [r/phoenixsc](https://reddit.com/r/phoenixsc)

### Minecraft original images

> This is not meant to be a full collection of Minecraft assets, but instead some images needed either for creating cursed assets or images, such as inventories.
